# ASSET: Astrodynamics Software and Science Enabling Toolkit

ASSET (Astrodynamics Software and Science Enabling Toolkit) is a modular, extensible library for trajectory design and optimal control.
It uses a custom implementation of vector math formalisms to enable rapid implementation of dynamical systems and automatic differentiation.
The phase object is the core of the optimal control functionality, and by linking multiple phases together, the user can construct scenarios of arbitrary complexity.
A newly developed high performance interior-point optimizer (PSIOPT) is included with the library, which enables quick turnaround from concept to solution.

Development funded by NASA under Grant No. 80NSSC19K1643.
